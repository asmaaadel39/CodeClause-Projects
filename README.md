**Data Description**
We have three CSV files ( BollywoodActorRanking, BollywoodDirectorRanking, BollywoodMovieDetail ).

I done this project using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Seaborn libarary, Pandas package, and Matplotlib libarary.

**What's EDA?**
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyze the data using visual techniques. It is used to discover trends, patterns, or to check assumptions with the help of statistical summary and graphical representations.

**Difference between Data Analysis and Exploratory Data Analysis:**
Data Analysis helps in sorting out real trends from noisy data. EDA is an approach/philosophy for analyzing data using technique like: 1.) maximize insights into dataset.

The process consists of several steps:

1-Importing a dataset
2-Understanding the big picture
3-Preparation
4-Understanding of variables
5-Study of the relationships between variables
6-Brainstorming

**Pandas**
Pandas is built on top of two core Python librariesâ€”matplotlib for data visualization and NumPy for mathematical operations. Pandas acts as a wrapper over these libraries, allowing you to access many of matplotlib's and NumPy's methods with less code.
It used for Data Manipulation and data analysis.

**Seaborn and Matplotlib**
Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. Matplotlib makes easy things easy and hard things possible. Create publication quality plots. Make interactive figures that can zoom, pan, update.

**Insights of the project**

**From the Actor Ranking Dataset:**

when sorting the data based on "Normalized Rating":

we found that **Priyanka Chopra** got the highest movie count while **Kajol** got the lowest movie count.
**Aamir Khan** got the highest normalized rating.

when sorting the data based on "Movie count":

we found that **Akshay Kumar** got the highest movie count while **Abhishek Bachchan** got the lowest movie count.

When sorting the data based on "Googlehits"

we found that **Salman Khan** got the highest google hits while **Aamir Khan** got the lowest one.

when sorting the data based on "Normalized Movie Rank":

we found that **Asin** got the highest Normalized Movie Rating  while **Hrithik Roshan** got the lowest one.
Also we don't need to check for the normalized google rank cause we already know it from the google hits score.

**From the Director Ranking Dataset:**

when sorting the data based on "Movie count":

**Priyadarshan** got the highest movie count percentage, and the rest are in range out from 7% to 14%.

when sorting the data based on "Normalized Rating":

**Rajkumar Hirani**	got the highest rate, and the rest are in range out from 8% to 14%.

When sorting the data based on "Googlehits".

**Raj Kumar Gupta** got the highest google hits while **Anurag Kashyap** got the lowest one.

**From the Movie Dataset**

The highest movie genre from the top 20 is ( **Drama**, **Comdey** , **Romance** ) , and the lowest one is (**Action**).
The highest number of **Movies** was released in **2010** while the lowest one was in **2001**.
